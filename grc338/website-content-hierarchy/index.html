            <p>
              Friends, you can now order Boba Guys via Doordash and Order Ahead from our re-opened locations. We pride ourselves on being a next-level company, so we want to take it slow with a limited menu during this pandemic. We prioritize public health, which is why we were one of the earliest businesses to close in the entire country back in March. Our protocol and procedures will evolve over time as we keep up with updated CDC guidelines and industry best practices.
