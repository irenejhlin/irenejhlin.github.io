            <p>Think about different areas of your life. When you’re thinking about a particular scene, think about the everyday details that you would expect to see there. If you’re drawing a landscape scene one might expect to see a tree(s), grass, but they might also expect to see birds, deer, or a pond. Think about your scene and pull details from reality, no matter what style of art you are creating. Make a word association list for each idea you have. The list should be around 25–30 words for each idea you have.</p>
            <p>When you’re starting with a new idea, take the time to do 5–10 thumbnail sketches. Sketching out your ideas will help you get a better lay of the land, flesh out what doesn’t work before you make it too far into the design, and can be a reference point for future work. It can help you form new ideas for other work you can create and is a good starting point for any project.

            <h3>Learn how Patreon works!</h3>
            <p>Patreon is a membership platform that connects content creators with fans and supporters. Mainly, it offers financial tools that let supporters subscribe to projects that give creators a predictable income stream as they continue to create content. The platform is a modern take on the classic concept of patronage. Historically, artists such as painters, musicians, and authors sometimes relied on wealthy donors' patronage to finance their work. Patreon takes that core concept and enables a much larger audience to finance artists and creators they like at affordable monthly rates. Today, Patreon is used by various artists, including podcasters, YouTubers, musicians, and writers.</p>
