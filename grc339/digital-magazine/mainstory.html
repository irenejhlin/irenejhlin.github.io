        <p>For the month of July there are a lot of summer themed prompts! Art prompts are here for you to take inspiration from and challenge your art!

        <p>Art prompts are a fun and chill way to explore and practice! On any given day the slightest, smallest interaction or observation can change your whole perspective or outlook.

These prompts can help spark your imagination and get you back on your feet after a creative slump.</p>
        <p>Before we jump right into art prompts, let's take a minute to break down the process of coming up with ideas so that you’re overflowing with creativity and never go back to feeling stuck. Always keep a notepad with you because you never know when inspiration will strike. Write down or sketch out every idea that comes to mind and keep them all in the same place. There isn’t one right way for your idea and most of the time ideas don’t last very long so it helps to get all of them down on paper when it comes to mind.</p>
        <p>Think about different areas of your life. When you’re thinking about a particular scene, think about the everyday details that you would expect to see there. If you’re drawing a landscape scene one might expect to see a tree(s), grass, but they might also expect to see birds, deer, or a pond. Think about your scene and pull details from reality, no matter what style of art you are creating. Make a word association list for each idea you have. The list should be around 25–30 words for each idea you have.</p>
        <p>When you’re starting with a new idea, take the time to do 5–10 thumbnail sketches. Sketching out your ideas will help you get a better lay of the land, flesh out what doesn’t work before you make it too far into the design, and can be a reference point for future work. It can help you form new ideas for other work you can create and is a good starting point for any project. Take notes when reading the prompts below to expand on any ideas you have when thinking about them. These art prompts are a great way for you to figure out what subjects you are drawn to and are a good starting point for other ideas you will have. You can use these prompts to create artwork with any medium.</p>
